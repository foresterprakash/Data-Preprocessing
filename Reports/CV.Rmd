I am Prakash Lamichhane, a Research Officer, Data Analyst, and Ecologist with a strong educational background in Forestry and Landscape Ecology. My career spans practical experience in forest management and carbon monitoring, driven by a passion for climate science and environmental conservation efforts. I had a significant growth on data analysis and statistical application in any sector data with mastering in MS Excel and R programming in recent years. I am particularly interested in advancing my academic growth in data science and statistical analysis using R programming. I am looking for an opportunity to work with data science enthusiastic group and  committed to contribute towards its growing applicability in biological science.
